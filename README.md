## 1. Introduction :
- This project is to implement medical data extraction, and this project will auto classify and extract useful information from medical forms and documents.
- Implemented this project by using libraries - Pytesseract(Runs On Google Optical Character Recognition-OCR), Computer Vision, Regex, PDF2Image, Pytest.
- At first we use PDF2Image library to convert PDF into image, clean the image with Computer Vision by Adaptive Thresholding Techinique and extract useful data by using Pytesseract(OCR) and regex.
- This project works well on medicalcare documents(like extracting name, patient details, medicine, diagonosis) and this saves time as it reduces human work and saves time from 10 min to less than a second.

# 5. Key Features
### **High Accuracy with OCR Extraction**
* Leverages advanced Computer Vision techniques like OCR and pytesseract extraction.
* Focuses on relevant sections of handwritten medical forms.
* Ensures precise data capture.

### **Regex for Comprehensive Data Extraction**
* Uses advanced Regex patterns.
* Extracts detailed medical information like patient details, symptoms, prescriptions, and more.
* Enhances the depth of insights from documents.

### **Error Correction for Improved Reliability**
* Integrates an error correction mechanism.
* Uses a medical vocabulary model to predict and correct handwritten text errors.
* Ensures higher accuracy in critical data fields like medicine names.
* Uses RAG model to get the right output from the extracted text.


## 6. Image processing
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aabfb1b-4df2-4293-8728-50780478b725)

We initially chose to preprocess the images using OpenCV, starting with normal thresholding. However, this method can cause areas with shadows or noise to fade out, leading to data loss.

To improve our approach, we decided to switch to adaptive thresholding. This technique divides the image into smaller regions, applying different threshold values to each. As a result, adaptive thresholding produces significantly better outcomes compared to normal thresholding.

## 8. Notebook
For all these above trials, used jupyter books and developed the small bits of the functionalities., which can be used later while designing the class.
